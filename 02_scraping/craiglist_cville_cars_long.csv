A few changes have been made but it's largely the vehicle that was built on the show - still has the Hemi V8 and 4 spd Atlas.  It now sits on 39.5's, it's been boat-sided and the cage is different.  Recently the D44s were removed and a pair of one tons (D60/Sterling) out of a Super Duty were trussed and swapped in to better match the rest of the Jeep.  The interior of the axles are in good shape as the covers have been removed, inspected and filled with fresh gear oil.  The front axle is open and the rear is a limited-slip, so they just need lockers, depending on your usage.  It's been barely used over the last 10 or so years that I've owned it and it's too nice to just let sit.  I started to convert it to more of a street legal vehicle a while back (and was going to run some smaller tires on narrower axles) so the flares were added - they need to be removed or trimmed for the 39's.  Fires right up and sounds great.Drivetrain:- Low mileage '05 5.7L Hemi and attached automatic trans (545RFE) with Lokar shifter, 4 speed Atlas transfer case, Super Duty axles (leaf spring era - confirmed a D60 not a D50). Suspension/steering:Gen-Right suspension system - 3 link front, 4 link rear, stretch kit, w/ steel corners and remote reservoir King coil-overs.  Currie Sway Loc air controlled front sway bar.  AGR steering box w/ hydraulic assist.Tires/wheels39"" Iroks on Mickey Thompson aluminum 16x10, Front tires in great shape, will need rear tires.Misc:Crawler gas tank skidSpeedglass windshieldMastercraft seats front and rearElectric fan, trans coolerSoft top12 volt guy switch panel, LED tail lightsHarnesses and a few spare parts included.Installed a front bumperInstalled a new heavy-duty winch plate, mounted the Ramsey 9500 winch and wired to batteryPermanent mount for track bar completedOff-Road Anonymous high-steer knuckle kit installedBarnes heavy duty drag-link and tie-rod installed with new heim jointsHydro-assist steering completed and functionalSwapped out master cylinder with 2001 Dodge 2500 master cylinderAdjusted control arms and set pinion angleCompleted fuel filler hoseWhat you see in the pics reflects its current condition and is what you will get.  Only the soft top is included.  It needs just a few lug nuts, e-brake cables and the brake rotors are pretty crusty.  The CEL is on for emissions stuff.  The key needs to be cycled a couple of times to prime the fuel system if it sits for a while but runs great after that.  Lots of good parts with low miles and little use.  Serious buyers only.  Please only contact if you are ready to view and buy.  No trades."
